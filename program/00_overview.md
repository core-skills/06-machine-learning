## Aims

1. Introduce fundamental concepts of supervised and what are the crucial steps in an end-to-end machine learning strategy from data.
2. Explore traditional supervised classification techniques and the evaluation metrics for error analysis.
3. Introduce open-source toolboxes and packages that can be applied to mining/energy data.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Understand the key steps to develop a machine learning investigation from data.
2. Understand how to evaluate, validate and prevent problems such as overfitting and underfitting.
3. Understand which techniques are best suited for a classification problem and how to design the learning model.
4. Understand the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques to select the correct type of model given available data.
